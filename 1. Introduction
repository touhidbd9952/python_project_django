Django is a back-end server side web framework.

Django is free, open source and written in Python.

Django makes it easier to build web pages using Python.

/////////How does Django Work?/////////////////////////////////////////////

Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).

    Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
    View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
    Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.
